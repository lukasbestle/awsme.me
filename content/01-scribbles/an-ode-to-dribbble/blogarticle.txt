Text: I started 'dribbbling' in August '11 thanks to (link:http://twitter.com/matthewleak text: Matthew Leak). It's crazy to see how far I and the dribbblers I follow have come! For those of you who don't know what (link: http://dribbble.com text: Dribbble) is shame on you! Here's a small explanation:

>Dribbble is a community of designers answering that question each day. Web designers, graphic designers, illustrators, icon artists, typographers, logo designers, and other creative types share small screenshots that show their work, process, and current projects.

### Good Work, Nice Shot
Sharing small screenshots is just the tip of the iceberg. Dribbble serves as a quick way to recieve feedback from thousands of other creatives around the world through comments and likes. This is awesome when you get contructive feedback but a lot of the time all you get is "Good Work" or "Nice Shot". Frankly this is not useful to anyone. I hold my hands up and say I sometimes do this. We should try to be a little more constructive, take a minute or two, really look at the shot and analyse it. We'd want the same.

### I Wish I Could Do That
Dribbble is also a great source of inspiration for me, especially a year ago. Every single day I'm amazed by the work people produce and this is such a hugh motivator, it make me just want to open up Photoshop and give myself a challenge. This is also the reason why I've started doing a lot more rebounds lately. "What's a rebound?" I hear you ask:

>A rebound is a shot in reply to another shot. Rebounds offer a way to follow up and “link” two shots together. For example, a sketch can be rebounded with a finished design, or alternate concepts of a design can be rebounded so there’s a reference trail to follow.
>
>Rebounds can also be purely for fun—what you're working on doesn't have to be for work. :) For example, any player can create games or memes allowing other Dribbble players to riff off an initial shot to get their takes on the same idea.

Rebounds have really helped me improve as a designer. Sometimes the hardest part of designing is knowing what to design, rebounds solve this problem. You're already provided with what to design, all you have to do is create you're own variation. I really recommend taking part in Playoffs, they can be a lot of fun and it's really interesting seeing what others come up with.

### Dribbble Got Me Hired
A lot of dribbblers use dribbble as their portfolio or CV and you can be hired directly through dribbble. Both full-time jobs & most freelancing gigs I've had so far have been through dribbble. I doubt I'd be where I am today without it. Dribbble is also a good place to activitly find a job. Big companies like Facebook, AOL & Microsoft and other smaller companies and agencies post job offers on dribbble Job Board.

### Become Drafted
Seen as we're talking about dribbble why not give away **2 invites** right now! All you have to do is tweet this post and send some of your work to **(email: timothy@achumba.com)**.

### To Conclude
Dribbble is a great platform to discover, learn and share work. It has opened a lot of doors for a lot of people. In a way dribbble was directly responsible for making me the designer I am today. I'd just like to say I appreciate everyone who follows me! I'd also like to thank the guys behind it all!
