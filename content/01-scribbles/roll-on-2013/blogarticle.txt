Text: The year is almost over and it's been a pretty amazing one but I don't really want to reminisce too much about it. It's is almost history. I really want to focus on next year in this post.

There are a lot of things I'm looking forward to in the new year, a lot of apps, games and albums being released. What have you got planned for 2013?

I really want to surprise myself next year. I want to challenge myself in ways I haven't done before, maybe learn a new skill, even if it doesn't directly affect my career. Like maybe learn an instrument or start a blog. Something I've been doing recently is learn Javascript. I was able to watch and help out the Web Team at 6Wunderkinder this year with Wunderlist 2. It's crazy what they achieved.

I think you should also have this mentality towards next year. You should all try new things, push boundaries, surprise yourselves! This year was pretty awesome but next year can and will be better! Roll on 2013.

Happy Holidays!
