Text: 2012 was a crazy year for me, a lot happened in such a small space of time. I think I did about 5 years of growing up in 1 year. So here's my year in a short story.

### University
I was studying Web Design & Technology at The University of Bradford and well frankly, I wasn't really enjoying it. I felt like I wasn't really challenging myself with the course I chose. I had been freelancing as a web designer for about a year or so before I started and problem was, I already knew a lot of what was being taught and a lot of it was outdated at times wrong. Now don't get me wrong, University is great for the right person, I just think it wasn't for me.

I actually left Uni in late 2011 with the intention of possibly returning a year later. This was after receiving a job offer through dribbble from a Web Agency based in Manchester called (link: http://mobedia.co.uk text: Mobedia).

### Mobedia
Mobedia was my first real job and it had its ups and downs. Working at an agency is very different from freelancing. The first difference I noticed was the pace. The turn around was so quick, I just couldn't keep up and I was really struggling but I kept pushing and pushing. Regardless of how hard my time at Mobedia was, I wouldn't change it for the world. I met so many amazing people and learn so much, especaily from (link: http://twitter.com/savman_ text: David Savage) their Lead Designer.

I only spent 6 months at Mobedia but I know everything I learnt there helped me get to where I am right now, for that I'm super grateful!

### Manchester âœˆ Berlin
In March, I started a project called (link: http://dribbble.com/iam_timm/projects/38317-Halftime-App text: Halftime App): a dribbble client for OS X and I used 6Wunderkinder's (at that time) newest app: Wunderkit, to organise the project with a developer from America and somehow the guys at 6Wunderkinder got wind of this. They saw my designs and decided to feature my workspace on Wunderkit. I was stunned and honoured! What came next was even crazier to me.

I then received an email and a tweet from (link: http://twitter.com/christianreber text: Christian Reber) (CEO) basically offering me a chance to join the (link: http://6wunderkinder.com text: 6Wunderkinder) family. This was such a weird feeling because at that time, things weren't going amazing at Mobedia and I was beginning to question my skills as a designer but on the other hand, I was being offered an amazing opportunity.

I saw this as a huge risk, not only was I quitting a job for another one but I was relocating to a different country. I was petrified, until I actually went over there!

I was able to fly out there for about a week to check it out and I loved it! I really felt at home and the anxiety I was having practically vanished! I took the job and on April 5th I became a Wunderkind and as they say, "the rest is history".

I'm gonna fast forward a little here, I want to save my Berlin experience for separate posts. It's way too long to fit in just one.

### Wunderlist 2
Working on Wunderlist 2 has been so amazing! I was able to dip my creative fingers in many different pies. I got to work on the Mac App, iOS App, Website, API (I'm partially proud of this one considering I didn't know what GitHub was about 2 months ago.) and other bits and bobs. I learnt so so much about user interface design & experience. It's totally changed the way I design and think about design and it's just the beginning. The launch of Wunderlist 2 was the best Christmas present I could ever have asked for and I want to thank 6Wunderkinder for that!

2012 was a crazy year for me, a lot happened in such a small space of time. I can't wait to see what happens next year!
